# Machine Learning Project Functions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the process of training a deep learning model using the Sequential API and MLP gradient descent.
- Create graphs to visualize the evolution of loss and accuracy metrics during model training.
- Deploy Keras from TensorFlow and compare the accuracy of a deep learning model with regular linear regression.

## 1. Trained a Deep Learning Model using Sequential API and MLP Gradient Descent

To train your deep learning model, you followed these steps:

- Implemented a deep learning model using the Sequential API from Keras, allowing for easy construction of neural networks.
- Utilized MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) architecture, enabling the model to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
- Employed MLP gradient descent as the optimization algorithm to update the model's parameters and minimize the loss function during training.

## 2. Created an Evolution Graph for Loss and Accuracy

To monitor the progress of your model during training, you visualized the evolution of loss and accuracy metrics:

- Created a graph to track the loss metric, such as mean squared error (MSE), over increasing epochs.
- Observed the decreasing trend of the loss metric, indicating improved model performance as the epochs progressed.
- Plotted the accuracy metric, such as classification accuracy or mean absolute error (MAE), to evaluate the model's predictive power on unseen data.

## 3. Deployed Keras from TensorFlow and Achieved Superior Accuracy over Linear Regression

In your project, you compared the accuracy of your deep learning model with regular linear regression:

- Deployed Keras, a high-level neural networks API, from TensorFlow to facilitate deep learning model development.
- Evaluated the accuracy of your deep learning model and compared it to regular linear regression, a traditional machine learning algorithm.
- Demonstrated that the deep learning model outperformed linear regression in terms of accuracy, highlighting the superior predictive capabilities of the neural network.
